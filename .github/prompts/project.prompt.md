# LeadCore AI - Project Overview

LeadCore AI is an AI-powered SaaS for lead generation and enrichment. It scrapes data from Shopify, Etsy, G2, and Capterra, enriches leads via Claude, verifies emails, and exports results to CSV, Sheets, or Zapier. The platform integrates billing through Stripe and TownPay and tracks affiliate commissions via Rewardful. Designed for marketers and sales teams, LeadCore AI streamlines lead acquisition, enrichment, and workflow automation.

The project has been scaffolded with core infra (Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Rewardful).

Your role is to implement, integrate, and ship within the agreed timeline.
STRICTLY FOLLOW the codebase and the rules.
